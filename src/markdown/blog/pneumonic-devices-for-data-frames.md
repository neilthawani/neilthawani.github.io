<p>I was going through the <a href="http://swirlstats.com/" target="_blank">Swirl</a> tutorial for my R Programming course and got to the section on data frames. This is a neat pneumonic device for remembering four initial methods to run when encountering a new data set in R. Headstrong dim sum.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><u>head</u> - retrieve the first 10 rows of the frame; a second argument can be specified if the desired number is different than 10</li>
<li><u>str</u>(ong) - prints the <u>str</u>ucture of the frame including variable type, number of observations (rows), number of variables (columns), names of the columns and their first 10 variable values with respective data types</li>
<li><u>dim</u> - get the dimensions (# rows/# columns) of the frame</li>
<li><u>sum(mary)</u> - the <u>summary</u> method outputs the min, max, mean, median, and 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile values for all variables in the data frame</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Incidentally, I'm getting dim sum this weekend for the first time with some friends. I'll probably be thinking about this then, too.</p>
