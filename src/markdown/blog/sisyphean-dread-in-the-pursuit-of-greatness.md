<p>I like working off my calendar because it helps me stay focused. By chunking tasks into hours-long blocks of specific errands, chores, or activities, I can also fit goals like my <a href="http://www.lioninawhat.com/articles/open-sourcing-my-new-year-s-resolutions" target="_blank">New Year's resolutions</a> into slots of time when I'm focused doing only those things. But truth be told, I <em>feel</em> like I need a bigger <em>why</em>.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> do I need a bigger why? I've felt uninspired by the work I do outside of my day job - and I've always had a side project to distract me from improving products or writing tests. The purpose of this blog was to highlight my personal journey in a professional light. I decided to focus on the themes of technology and leadership, and this blog was built from scratch as a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/09/your-attitude-didnt-matter.html" target="_blank">labor of love</a>. This lack of inspiration may be more closely related to a sense of impatience in terms of my own growth, which I characterize by a sense of child-like excitement contained within the body of a slightly disgruntled man.</p>

<p>By open-sourcing my New Year's resolutions, I felt more compelled to stick to my word. Recently I fostered a dog for 48 hours. I have also started working on the <a href="http://nonprofitcanvaskit.com/" target="_blank">non-profit business model canvas</a> for an environmental non-profit that has yet to be formally named. Yes, I am bragging - and rightfully so. It takes a lot of work to be this awesome all the time. But truth be told - I fear that when I do the thing and make the stuff and be the person - when that journey is over - I will return to a state of <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&id=7f94112800" target="_blank">deep existential despair</a>. Also known as boredom. And I hate being bored.</p>

<p>I subscribe to a newsletter called <a href="http://breakingsmart.com/" target="_blank">Breaking Smart</a>, which has the tagline "seeking serendipity through technology." Venkatesh Rao, the writer of Breaking Smart, wrote about this existential despair in a post titled <a href="https://www.emailnewsletterstand.com/e/what-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-regular-people" target="_blank">"What Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Regular People."</a> He says many entrepreneurs view everything in their universe as things that either do or do not contribute to their goals with varying levels of risk to obtain those things. Without a purpose or sense of instrumentalism about the things they encounter in their day-to-day lives, these people experience a similar level of existential crisis after both success <em>and</em> failure. I consider my dog fostering experience to be my most recent failure. I had originally signed a form to keep him for many weeks, but even after housebreaking him and taking him to the office for half a day, the amount of stress overwhelmed the level of fun I had from having a dog, and I took him back to the shelter I got him from on my lunch break after just 48 hours of taking him home. My next dog will be smaller.</p>

<p>That night, I wrote a journal entry about my experience, what I had learned, and then took more notes on dog behavior. Even with a system of under-stimulating, academic-style knowledge acquisition, I apply my knowledge and exercise curiosity. Once again: even with experiences that promote growth, <em>why</em> do I feel a need for a bigger why? Well, for about 10 hours a day, I am either working, eating, working out, or getting ready to do any of the previous three things, and my energy is limited. One of the ways I work out is by doing yoga and meditating, and while I exercise mindfulness and staying present in my day-to-day life, I experience the doubt and sense of idleness expressed in this post at very innocuous moments. Ironically, I've even started to soak in experiences with greater appreciation than I did when I was younger. I have traveled to different countries, gotten lost in my own city on foot, and I have gone to one hip-hop dancing class. Instead of appreciating all the texture of what I've experienced, I fear something that hasn't happened yet - mastery - and feel a lack of inspiration, but is truly doubt of my own self-efficacy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I need to do this right the first time - and then every time after that.</em></p>

<p>This becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy, and I become more likely to abandon my goals. Which answers my original question.</p>

<p>I think that's part of being human, though. In hindsight, it actually makes sense. When I realize that I'll get used to any skill level or life experience over time, as long as I repeat it, I begin to wonder when I'll get used to it or when the next time I plateau will be. That uncertainty intimidates me when I look in the face of the goals I've set for myself. During the mundane process of honing my skill in a disciplined fashion, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx" target="_blank">I crave spontaneity</a> in the absence of a quick feedback loop. However, by applying those skills and seeing their impacts - with a new dog and new adventures with old projects, like this blog, I motivate myself to do more inspiring things and give myself permission to bask every now and then.</p>
