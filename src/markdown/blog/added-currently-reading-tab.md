<p>Tonight I added a "Currently Reading" panel above the tags list.</p>

<p>As an avid developer, I find myself watching many YouTube videos and <a href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank">Railscasts</a>, reading many StackOverflow articles, and rarely having the time to delve into a good book.</p>

<p>As part of an effort to continue my education outside of the <a href="/tags/14" target="_blank">virtual classroom</a>, I added this tab in an effort to share and track my progress.</p>
