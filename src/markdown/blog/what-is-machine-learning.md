"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel (1959)

"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." - Tom Mitchell (1997)

*e.g., playing a game*

**E**: the experience of playing many games

**T**: the task of playing the game

**P**: the probability that the program will win the next game

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

1. supervised learning and
2. unsupervised learning.
