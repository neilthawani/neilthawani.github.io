    <h1 class="blog-post-title">What's now, next, and later?</h1>

    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p>It's 5:53 am on a Monday. I think it's a great start to the week. It's quiet, dark outside, and the shades are still pulled on the windows.</p>
        <p>I'm cleaning my e-mail before I go into work for the morning. This is a task I usually reserve for Sundays, but yesterday I spent most of the day on Coursera, knocked out week 3 on R Programming and Machine Learning and looked into the new <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance" target="_blank">Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics</a> course I'm starting today. I got <em><u>so</em></u>. <em><u>much</em></u>. <em><u>done</em></u>. But at the same time, I was frustrated because I don't really count academic results as tangible results. Sure, my Github got a commit and I got a 5/5 on a quiz, but where's the stuff I share with society? Where's the good? Where's the wheat when all I perceive is chaff?</p>
        <p>Well, apparently my subconscious, internet-surfing mind decided to send <a href="https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645" target="_blank">an e-mail to me in the future</a>. The article in that link points to a product development methodology utilized by Noah Weiss, the VP of Product Development at FourSquare. I'd like to apply this same methodology to my life. I'm terrific at self-micromanaging, but sometimes I lose focus (like not updating this blog for 10 days straight).</p>
        <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>now - 70%</th>
                    <th>next - 20%</th>
                    <th>later - 10%</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>for the next 2-4 weeks</td>
                    <td>1-3 months out</td>
                    <td>3+ months out</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>The percentages cited are how much time one should dedicate toward planning for what's now, next, and later, and Weiss says that 'now' is a product of the length of your sprint. A question I'll have to answer is 'how long are my personal sprints?' I like Google's concept of <a href="http://firstround.com/article/How-to-Make-OKRs-Actually-Work-at-Your-Startup" target="_blank">quarterly OKRs</a>, so I think I can change the above durations to 3 months, 3-9 months, and 9+ months out, respectively, for more long-range goal-setting.</p>
        <p>After reading Reid Hoffman's <a href="http://www.thestartupofyou.com/" target="_blank">The Startup of You</a>, I've come to think of my life as a series of plans A, B, and Z while simultaneously being open to the experiences life may come to offer. I suppose my next step is to <a href="http://hive.org/20s/" target="_blank">craft a vision statement...</a></p>
