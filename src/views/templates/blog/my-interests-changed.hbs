        <p>This will not be a withdrawal of the declaration of self-actualization that was in <a href="/articles/50">the last blog post.</a> It will be a short story followed by a plan for action.</p>
        <p>In December 2011, I was at a national conference for an organization called <a href="http://www.aiesecus.org" target="_blank">AIESEC US</a>. It was a non-profit that I worked at in college that facilitated work-abroad exchange for university students. Typing that sentence took a few seconds longer than it should have - because I used to say that value proposition almost every day. At the beginning of each Fall semester at universities across the nation, recruitment for new AIESECers begins - it may be your campus' best-kept secret. Today, when a fellow alumnus shared a post from the AIESEC Mizzou recruitment page, I found this video I recorded about two years ago.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TOgvBOSsKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p>AIESEC was quite a big deal and gave me a lot of confidence in my self-efficacy. I made lifelong friendships and tapped into a love for organizational development that persists to this day in my new career as a software engineer. At that conference in December 2011, I came up with an idea for an app to streamline workflows at AIESEC conferences. I called it the M.A.T.T. - the Member Assignment and Task Tracker. I shared it with my former and future supervisors. They both thought it was cool and endorsed the idea. I even pitched it at a Startup Weekend and while the audience didn't think it was the sexiest idea, I had two business leaders in the audience give me their business cards and tell me to contact them when I made the app. I have their cards sitting behind me on my shelf.</p>
        <p>I have made database schema, UI wireframes, and diagrammed a product roadmap for creating the M.A.T.T., but for some reason, I haven't made the app. Which, as a developer, is generally the most fun part of the process. Instead, I learned Ruby on Rails and built <a href="http://www.iwanttobeavc.com" target="_blank">a different app</a>, investigated <a href="https://twitter.com/siliconprairie/lists/kc-startup-community
" target="_blank">social networks in Kansas City</a> and visualized them using D3.js, and started working on my front-end development skills while making toy Ruby and R scripts for a <a href="http://www.theleanlab.org" target="_blank">local non-profit</a>.</p>
        <p>I think, given my actions, I've been traveling the path of a web developer with an itch for hacktivism. But I want to go down a more technical path - I have the gift of a love of math. And that requires time that I currently don't have. For many, many months (44 since December 2011), I have put off completing the M.A.T.T. while doing other things. I decided to create the M.A.T.T. originally because I loved going to AIESEC conferences and connecting the pathways between logistics, training, and other programming, but now, I don't feel like I belong in that world. I think that my interests have shifted away from event management and logistics (although I am very good at them) to understanding how and why the logistics work and maybe how to make them more efficient. Of course, that is an analogy in reference to my <a href="/articles/50">previous blog post</a>, where I talked about improving measured systems. Right now, I'm looking at community gardens.</p>
